1.world wide web-www
-known as a web
-is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers
-connected to local computers through the internet
-these website contain text pages,digital images,audios,videos,etc.
-users can access the content of these sites from any part
of the world over the internet using their devices such as computers,
leptops,cell phones,etc.
-the WWW,along with internet,enables the retrieval and display of text
and media to your device.

2.client-servers communication
1.client "sometimes on"
-initiates a request to the server when interested.
-E.g.web brouser on your leptop or cell phone.
-doesn't communicate directly with other clients.
-needs to known the server's address.

2.server is "always on"
-services requests from many client hosts.
-E.d.web server for the www.example.com web site.
-doesn't initiate contract with the clients.
-needs a fixed,well-known address.  

3.SDLC Methodology
-The "software development life cycle"(SDLC) refers to a methodology with
clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software.in detail,
the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software 
development:

1.Requirement Gathering
2.Analysis
3.Designing
4.Implementation
5.Testing
6.Mantenance

4.Analysis & Design Environment 
-The analysis and design environment is aligned to the planing and analysis
phases of the SDLC. in this environment,the main processes that take place 
include carrying out an in-depth examination of the current system and the 
propose system.the system architeture is also defined and includes development
the design of the hardware,software and network requirements for the system.
within this environment,system and business analysts work closely with
software engineers.

5.The Development Environment 
-The development environment can also be a physical where development 
takes place and where software engineers interact.Another example of 
the development environment is the integrated development environment (IDE).
The IDE provides a platform where tools and development processes are 
coordinated in order to provide software engineers a convenient way
of accessing the resources they require during the development process.

ENVIRONMENTS IN INDUSTRY

3.The common build environment 
-the common build environment is closely aligned to the development
phase of the SDLC.in this environment software engineers merge the work done 
in the development environment.within this environment,software engineers
build system.these are used to automate the process of software compilation.

4.The testing environment 
-The test environment is where testing teams evaluate the application/quality.
program's this also allows computers programmers to find out and solve any
defects that may interfere with the application's smooth operation or 
degrade the user experience.

5.THE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT
-When the end-user use a web/mobile application,the program is operating
on a production server.it's been created in the production environment.


1.)Types of programming language:
-Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language.
the processor runs low-level programming directly withough the need of a 
compliler or interpreter,so the programs written in low-level language
can be run very fast.
-Low-leve language is further divided two parts-
1.Machine language:
-machine language is type of low level programming language. it is also called
as machine code or object code. machine language is easier to read because
it is normally displayed in binary or hexaadecimal from (base16) from.
it dose  not require a translator to convrert the programs because computers
directly understand the machine language programs.
-The advantage of machine language is that it  helps the programming to 
excute the programs faster than the high-level programming language.

2.Assembly language:
-Assemble language (ASM) is also a type of low level programming language
that is designed for specific processors.it represents the set of instrutions
in a symbolic and human-understandable from.it uses an assembler to convert
the assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.

The advantage of assembly language is that it requires less memory and 
less execution time to execute program.

2.) HIGH-LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:
-High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing users
friendly software programs and websites. this programming language requires
a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language
(execute the program).

-the main advantage of high level language is that it is easy to read,
write,and maintain.
-high-level programming language inludes PYTHON,JAVA,JAVA-SCRIPT,PHP,C#,
C++,OBJEVCTIVE C,COBOL,PERL,
